# ResponsibleAI-Airlift-Aug2020

## Overview

This repository contains content of a two-part workshop for using machine learning interpretability and fairness assessment (+ unfairness mitigation) to build fairer and more transparent models. The different components of the workshop are as follows:

1. Interpretability with glassbox models (EBM)
2. Explain blackbox models with SHAP (and upload explanations to Azure Machine Learning)
3. Run Interpretability on Azure Machine Learning
4. Model fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation

### Environment Setup 
You are expected to set-up your environment prior to attending the session. You need the followings:

1. Maching Learning Workspace 
2. Compute Instance (in AML workspace) 
3. Compute Cluster (single node) (in AML workspace)

Please follow the instruction below.

### Create Machine Learning Workspace using ARM ([Click here](https://github.com/mufajjul/ResponsibleAI-Airlift-Aug2020/tree/master/environment))

Or, you can use the GUI to setup the AML Workspace [(Click here)](https://ml.azure.com/)

### Clone repo in your Compute Instance 

Please follow the instruction on this link  [(Click here)](https://github.com/mufajjul/ResponsibleAI-Airlift-Aug2020/tree/master/environment/git-clone)
