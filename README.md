# ResponsibleAI-Airlift-Aug2020

## Overview

This repository contains content of a two-part workshop for using machine learning interpretability and fairness assessment (+ unfairness mitigation) to build fairer and more transparent models. The different components of the workshop are as follows:

1. Interpretability with glassbox models (EBM)
2. Explain blackbox models with SHAP (and upload explanations to Azure Machine Learning)
3. Run Interpretability on Azure Machine Learning
4. Model fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation
